the leaning tree carried a “blazed” scar with markings similar to those
on the white-oak half-way between the cliff and the glade. Like the
other scar, this one was old, and the bark had long since healed around
the edges of the ax-wound. But the markings, which were cut into the
heart-wood, were still quite distinct.
