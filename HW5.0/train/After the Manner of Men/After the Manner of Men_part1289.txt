“It’s some o’ that new-fangled, high-speed tool-steel that you temper
by heatin’ it white-hot and coolin’ it in a fan blast. Jenkins, the
Whitlow blacksmith, was showin’ me a piece of it last Sat’day night at
Tait’s. Looked like it might ’a’ been cut off the same bar with these
little chunks o’ Jim Sawyer’s.”
