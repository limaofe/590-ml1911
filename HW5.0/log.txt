I used simple RNN model. 
I stacked several recurrent layers one after the other in order to increase the representational power of a network. 
I also used l2 regularization in the dense layer to deal with overfitting.
The model works pretty well on training data with the auc higher than 0.8. 
However, when it works on validation dataset, the auc is only about 0.5. There still exists overfitting, maybe I should magnify the l2 regularization.
