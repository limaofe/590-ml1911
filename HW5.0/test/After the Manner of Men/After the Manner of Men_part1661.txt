apologist for my sex. I have only one excuse, Richardia; it wasnâ€™t
merely propinquity--as you and Poictiers seemed to think. I had never
known what love was until I met you. Elizabeth is going to marry
Poictiers, and you must believe me when I say that I think just as
much of her--and in the same way--as I did before. But let that pass.
